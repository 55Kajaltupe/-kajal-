when execute code using postfix operator then the output is :
       i=11 and n=0
And after when use postfix increment operator it first increment i value that is i= 11 and then the  11% 5 then 1 stored in n.
 
After when use prefix operator output is :
       i=11 n=1
In the case of prefix operator it perform 10%5 first and store 0 in n.

 In this pgm 6 printed because postfix increment operator which prints or stores value first and then increment it . That's why 6 is printed twice.
